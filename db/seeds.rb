# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# reservations seeds
# reservation = Reservation.create(
#   user_id: 1,
#   room_id: 1,
#   start_date: Date.new(2024, 1, 20),
#   end_date: Date.new(2024, 1, 28),
#   price: 200,
#   total: 1600,
